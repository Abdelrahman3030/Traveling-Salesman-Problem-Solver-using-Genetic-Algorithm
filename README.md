This Python script presents a solution to the classic Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The objective is to find the most optimal route that visits a set of cities exactly once and returns to the starting city, minimizing the total distance traveled. The GA incorporates key components such as population initialization, roulette wheel selection, order crossover, and scramble mutation. Users can customize parameters such as population size, crossover probability, mutation probability, and the number of cities. The script outputs the evolution of routes over generations, culminating in the identification of the best route and its corresponding distance. This repository serves as an educational resource for understanding and experimenting with GAs applied to combinatorial optimization problems, offering insights into the mechanics of evolutionary algorithms.
